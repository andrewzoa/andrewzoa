  <p>Dr. Joshua Bowen is right on the money with this one! Everything written below is him. 
Consensus: what is it, and why do we talk about it?

If you have ever mentioned the consensus scholarly position on a particular topic - especially if it relates to the Bible - you will likely hear someone say, “Consensus doesn’t make it true” or “That’s an appeal to authority!” Of course, people are rarely arguing (in my experience) that consensus proves that their argument is necessarily correct. So why do we talk about it?

Well, what is consensus? At least, how is it frequently used in this context? When someone says that there is scholarly consensus concerning a particular issue, they usually mean that most scholars that work or specialize in that part of the field agree on that issue. It doesn’t not mean that absolutely everyone agrees (although that could be the case), but rather that a vast majority do. This is why you will often see modifiers like “general” or “overall” placed before “consensus”. 

So why cite the consensus if it does not prove your case? While it may seem obvious, if the majority of experts in a particular field of study all agree on something, while it is not necessarily correct, there is a reason they all agree. But contrary to what some might think (particularly in certain areas of Christian apologetics), it is not because of an anti-supernatural bias. Rather, they are all coming to the same data points and determining that a particular model best accounts for and explains them. If you are studying that topic, it would be absolutely foolish to disregard what all the people who have gained an expertise in that area have concluded. We need to take scholarly consensus seriously. 

But I think there is another, perhaps more important point to be made here. The people who normally challenge and modify the positions of the consensus are those who have been trained in that area of the field, engaged very seriously with the findings, and come up with a (usually slightly modified) model that addresses and accounts for the data points with greater precision. But this is the material point: they have been well trained, studied the data points, know the arguments, and can account for the data better than what had been argued before. 

Now, does that mean that it is impossible for someone who is not formally trained to overturn scholarly consensus? No, of course not. But it is incredibly difficult and (in my experience) quite a rare occurrence. Usually, what I see happening is someone who has a half-baked theory, often driven by a prior commitment, who argues that their “new” idea (which is usually not new at all) is the correct one. When someone responds by citing the consensus scholarly position, that is usually the moment when the above-mentioned challenges to the consensus make their appearance.

So what am I saying? First, the consensus position is held for a reason. If you are going to challenge it, that is fantastic! However, you need to do so responsibly by first seriously engaging with what the relevant experts say (this is one of the reasons why dissertations contain a “History of Research” section). If you don’t have the requisite training in the field, it would be wise to humbly consider very seriously why the consensus holds their positions instead of dismissing someone citing their conclusions out of hand.
